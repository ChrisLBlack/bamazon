# bamazon

"Bamazon" is a CLI app that demonstrates my knowledge of using a MySQL Database, JavaScript, and Node.js.  It is essentially a store front where the "user" enters their order and the app checks if what they want is in stock.  If it is, the app "places" their order, if not, it tells them of the current stock on hand.  

The app useses the npm "inquirer" to ask the user the question "What is the 'ID Number' of the product you would like to buy?". Below, we're entering 4001 for tooth brushes.
